# Twitter Bot Removal Extension

An open-source browser extension to enhance your Twitter experience by removing known bot accounts from your timeline, quote tweets, and mentions.

Acts like a public record of identified bot accounts and hides their tweets when the extension is on. It does not read your Twitter data and can't access your Twitter account. It only checks if a tweet was sent by an identified bot and filters if so.

## Features

- Removes posts from identified bot accounts
- Cleans up your timeline, quote tweets, and mentions
- Can be turned off at any moment
- Open-source and community-driven

## Installation

Download this repo and add it as a custom extension in any Chrome-based browser.
